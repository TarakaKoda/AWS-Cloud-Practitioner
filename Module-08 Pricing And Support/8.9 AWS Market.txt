  > AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog that includes thousands of software listings from independent software vendors.
    You can use AWS Marketplace to find, test, and buy software that runs on AWS.

    - For each listing in AWS Marketplace, you can access detailed information on pricing options, available support,
      and reviews from other AWS customers.

    - You can also explore software solutions by industry and use case. For example, suppose that your company is in the
      healthcare industry. In AWS Marketplace, you can review use cases that software helps you to address, such as
      implementing solutions to protect patient records or using machine learning models to analyze a patientâ€™s medical
      history and predict possible health risks.

  > Learning objectives
  - In this module, you will learn how to:
    - Summarize the benefits of the AWS Global Infrastructure.
    - Describe the basic concept of Availability Zones.
    - Describe the benefits of Amazon CloudFront and edge locations.
    - Compare different methods for provisioning AWS services.

  - To understand the AWS global infrastructure, consider the coffee shop. If an event such as a parade, flood, or power
    outage impacts one location, customers can still get their coffee by visiting a different location only a few blocks
    away.

  - This is similar to how the AWS global infrastructure works.
